## Python's Copying Mechanisms: Shallow vs. Deep Copy

Efficiently managing object copies in Python is fundamental for robust programming. Let's dive in:

### Shallow Copy (`copy.copy()`)

This function duplicates the outer object but shares references to nested objects. Any changes made to the original propagate to the copy.

### Deep Copy (`copy.deepcopy()`)

Here, a full independent duplicate of the original object and all its nested structures is created. Changes in the original object do not affect the copy.

#### Summary:
- **Shallow Copy**: Structure copied, references shared.
- **Deep Copy**: Complete independent duplicate.

Understanding these mechanisms prevents unexpected behaviors in Python programs. Explore Python's `copy` module for efficient coding!
